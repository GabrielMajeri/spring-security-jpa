# spring-security-jpa

This repository contains the source code for the [Spring Boot + Spring Security with JPA authentication and MySQL from scratch tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNt3GHuayXs) by Koushik Kothagal.

## Running the code

This app is built with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and uses [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). You can run it from the command line or using an IDE such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

The demo requires a locally running MySQL database to connect to.

If you have [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed, you can start a MySQL container by running:

```shell
docker-compose up
```
